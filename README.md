# CoreAp
A minimal ASP.NET Core 2.1 Web API utilizing feature folders.

This isn't a fork of [Spencer Schneidenbach's Opinionated ASP.NET Core project](https://github.com/schneidenbach/RecessOpinionatedApiInAspNetCore) 
but most of this project's set up and initial development were constructed from that template.

Basically, this is a minimal feature structured ASP.NET Core 2.1 webapi.
